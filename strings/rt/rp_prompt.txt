(Welcome to Fablekeep)
<br> Mighty PSYDON has failed. I ensure what he finished comes to plan. I will be their greatest devil, their greatest enemy to be their greatest friend.
It is the Age of Rediscovery.
<br> <br> It is the year 1500 Post Psydonia. The world has emerged from technological repression and abuse after the fall of New Psydonia and the ancient Dwarven Federation.
It is not known why the Dwarven Federation failed; some say it was because of inhumane cultists, some say it was Ten, but there is one thing that is certain...
... The people of Earth must be tried; they must be tested.
<br> <br> The typical round of Fablefield is one shaped by the freeform nature of the server. Do and explore what you want, be who you want to be, and discover new techniques.
Will you realize an old dream? Or will you bring about the end of Fablefield?
